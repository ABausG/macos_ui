# Contributing to macos_ui

This is a new and very big project, so I am still working things out. As a baseline, I suggest
that anyone who wants to contribute in a significant way should add themselves to the list in [this
discussion post](https://github.com/GroovinChip/macos_ui/discussions/7). I will then add you to the 
repo as a contributor. If the list gets big enough, I may consider opening a Discord server for more
spontaneous discussion.
